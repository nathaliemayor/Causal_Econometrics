We analyze the effects of temporary employment programs for disadvantaged workers in the US (ref. National Supported Work Demonstration (NSW)). In particular, the NSW randomly assigned applicants to the training program. While the treatment group received 9 to 18 months of subsidized employment and some additional support, the control group did not receive any assistance from the program. In 1978 the earnings of the participants in the treatment and control group (re78) were collected and compared. Some pre-treatment variables for both groups were measured as well. 

The data used can be found in the data folder.
